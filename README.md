Bull Cow Game: 

The first game is a simple yet engaging one. The objective of
the game is to guess an isogram (a word with no repeating letters).
At the start of the game, the player will be given the number of letters
the word contains and the number of lives they have (which is equal to 
the number of letters in the word). After every guess, the player will be given 
the number of bulls (number of correct letters in the correct position) and cows
(the number of correct letters in the wrong position). The objective of the game 
is to guess the isogram before running out of lives!
